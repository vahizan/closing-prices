# Full-Stack Development Challenge

How I approached the challenge
- 
- Researched on compound interest formula
- Created utils file to handle compound interest logic
- Then built the backend endpoints and plugged the util functions into the responses
- After that, I worked on the frontend, with a crappy first draft
- Wired up the backend with the frontend input components
- Finally,finished up by polishing the UI.

What I like
-
- The UI
- Modularity of the functions in the utils files

What bits of my solution Iâ€™d like to improve upon
-
- I would like to refactor the App.tsx file further
- Unit tests could be more robust
- Inconsistencies with typescript type declarations, which I would clean up
