# closing-prices

How to run the project
-
- yarn install
- run yarn start
- disable ad block
 
How I approached the challenge
-
- Created utils file to get data from api
- Then built the backend endpoint and plugged the util function into the responses to handle cors
- After that, I worked on the frontend, with a crappy first draft
- Finally, Wired up the backend with the frontend input components

What I like
-
- Modularity of the functions in the utils file and custom hook

What bits of my solution Iâ€™d like to improve upon
-
- I would like to refactor the App.tsx file further
- Unit tests could be more robust
- Inconsistencies with typescript type declarations, which I would clean up
- UI could've been much better and should've implemented a dark version to keep it similar to the wireframe
